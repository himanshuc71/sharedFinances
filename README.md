# sharedFinances
App allows users to plan their shared budget and keep track of it. So they can increase their savings and never worry about overspending.


To get started, users can press the "Plan Budget" corner in the top left corner of the large display screen. From here, they will be given the option to specify how much money they'd like to allocate to a specific category for the given week.

Using a Shared Finances app on their phone, users are then able to track the different purchases they make and see if they’re sticking to their goals. After entering them, the users’ purchases will then show up directly on the large display screen as both a log and a deduction from the category-- making it easier than ever to know what money was spent where and to better stay on top of your budget!
